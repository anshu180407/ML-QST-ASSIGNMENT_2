# AI Usage Disclosure

## Disclosure

I used AI tools occasionally during this project for guidance and
clarification. The AI helped me better understand parts of the
assignment requirements, think through possible model designs, and debug
a few coding errors.

However, the full implementation, experimentation, testing, and
validation were carried out by me. I carefully reviewed, modified where
necessary, and verified all components before including them in the
final submission.

## How AI Was Used

AI was used for:

-   Clarifying assignment requirements and track constraints
-   Discussing how a Transformer-based model could be applied to
    classical shadow data
-   Debugging specific PyTorch errors
-   Improving the clarity and structure of documentation

All final design decisions and code were reviewed and validated
independently.

## Verification

To ensure correctness, I:

-   Verified that the reconstructed density matrices satisfy physical
    constraints:
    -   Trace equal to 1
    -   Non-negative eigenvalues
    -   Hermiticity
-   Monitored fidelity and trace distance during training
-   Executed the full pipeline (data generation → training → evaluation)
    multiple times to ensure reproducibility

The final submission reflects my independent understanding and
verification of the work.
